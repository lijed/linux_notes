## curl (60) SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK

The error message you encountered, "curl (60) SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK," typically indicates an issue with the SSL certificate or SSH key being used during a curl request.

Here are a few possible reasons that could cause this error:

1. Expired or Invalid Certificate: The SSL certificate presented by the server might be expired, self-signed, or generated by an untrusted Certificate Authority (CA). In such cases, curl will consider the certificate as not valid.
2. Incorrect Hostname: If the hostname in the URL does not match the Common Name or Subject Alternative Name of the SSL certificate, curl will raise this error. Make sure the requested hostname matches the hostname on the certificate.
3. Missing CA Certificates: curl relies on a bundle of trusted CA certificates to validate the SSL certificate presented by the server. If this bundle is missing, outdated, or misconfigured, it can result in the SSL peer certificate error. Updating or reinstalling the CA certificates may resolve the issue.
4. Firewall or Proxy Issues: Some firewalls or proxies may intercept SSL/TLS connections and present their own certificates instead. These certificates might be invalid or not trusted by curl, triggering the error.
5. SSH Key Mismatch: If you are using SSH to establish the connection, the remote server's SSH key might have changed, indicating a possible man-in-the-middle attack. Carefully verify the authenticity of the remote host before proceeding.

To troubleshoot this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that the SSL certificate being used is valid, up-to-date, and issued by a trusted CA.
2. Verify that the hostname in the URL matches the Common Name or Subject Alternative Name of the SSL certificate.
3. Update or reinstall the CA certificates bundle on your system.
4. Check if any firewalls or proxies are interfering with the connection and causing certificate mismatches.
5. For SSH connections, confirm the remote server's SSH key fingerprint and validate its authenticity.

Keep in mind that the specific steps to resolve this error may vary depending on your operating system, network configuration, and the details of your curl command.
